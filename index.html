    <h1>Jonathan Hong</h1>
    <p>
      Hi, I'm a second-year undergraduate at the University of Pennsylvania, studying Computer and Information Science in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
      I'm currently interested in computer graphics and systems engineering/programming. Recently, I've been working a lot with C/C++ and OpenGL.
      In my free time, I like to write, play oboe, watch tennis, and go on long walks.

    <h2>Monte-Carlo Path Tracer</h2>
      <h3><i>January 2024 - Present</i></h3>

      <p>
        A project built upon approximating the Light Transport Equation in order to render scenes using realistic light physics.
        Scenes are rendered on the GPU using OpenGL/GLSL. GUI and GL window created using C++ and Qt.
      </p>
      <p><b>Features Responsible:</b></p>
      <ul style="list-style-type:square">
        <li>Na√Øve Lighting Estimation</li>
        <li>Direct Lighting Estimation</li>
        <li>Multiple Importance Sampling (MIS)</li>

    <h2>Multiplayer and Singleplayer Chess (against Computer)</h2>
      <h3><i>November 2022 - August 2023</i></h3>

      <p>
        A classic game of chess, written in Java, with Swing and AWT libraries. Two gameplay modes supported.
        Either play locally with a friend (multiplayer), or play singleplayer against a beginner chess bot.
        Autonomous decision making implemented using Minimax algorithm. Also researched Monte Carlo Tree Search
        and Alpha-Beta pruning for greater max-depth board state searching.
      </p>
      <p><b>Features:</b></p>
      <ul style="list-style-type:square">
        <li>Minimax algorithm for optimizing board state</li>
        <li>
          Experimented with various board state evaluation functions to see which heuristics
          influenced game outcome the most
        </li>
        <li>Game logic properly implemented (checkmate, stalemate, en passant, castling, etc.)</li>
        <li>Object-oriented design of all chess pieces and their various rules/functions in the game</li>
        <li>Possible move highlighting when piece on board is selected</li>
        <li>Java Swing and AWT libraries used for the GUI and graphics</li>
        <li>Created pixel art sprites to represent the chess pieces</li>
      </ul>
