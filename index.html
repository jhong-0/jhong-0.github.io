    <h1>Jonathan Hong</h1>
    <p>
      Hi, I'm a second-year undergraduate at the University of Pennsylvania, studying Computer and Information Science in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
      I'm currently interested in computer graphics and systems engineering/programming. Recently, I've been working a lot with C/C++ and OpenGL.
      In my free time, I like to write, play oboe, watch tennis, and go on long walks.

        A simulation of the double pendulum system, a system that is known for its chaotic nature. In addition,
        its difficulty in being analyzed by a classical Newtonian model invites the application of Lagrangian mechanics
        for its study and examination. A presentation on the project, and the physics content involved with its 
        implementation is provided above.
